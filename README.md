Strategy
- My robot first goes to the Diagnosis module and gets a Sample available from there.
- Then she goes to the Molecules module and queries until the molecule she needs is there.
- Then she takes the molecules she needs and adds them into a dynamic list.
- She puts it in the dynamic list because a robot cannot carry more than 10 molocules, so she has to reduce her molecules.
- From there, she goes to the Laboratory module, produces drugs for the Sample she receives from Diagnosis and gets a health point.
